# Build An API for Meowtownâ„¢

## Learning Competencies
- Design and architect an API for the public with good documentation.

## Summary

Your mission: Design and document an API against Meowtown.
This API is meant to be consumed by the public. Think about how Twitter or
Github built their API against their app(s). You will be wearing an API designer/Architect
hat and think about how you want to expose data and services to the public just like
Twitter and Github did.


## Endpoints ([what's an API Endpoint?](http://bit.ly/1jIgbNw))
- `[GET]` list of cats
- `[GET]` a cat by id
- `[POST]` create a cat 
- `[PUT]` modify a cat by id 
- `[DELETE]` delete a cat by id 

## Statuses
It is important to always send back the appropriate status codes with your API response.
The following HTTP status codes are possible in response to a request:

<table>
<thead>
<th>HTTP Status Code</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Description</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>OK (Immediate response)</td>
<td>The request was a success and the response includes the
requested data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>OK (Immediate response)</td>
<td>The request was received and queued for processing, but not yet
processed. Usually in the case of a POST request</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>400</td>
<td>Bad Request</td>
<td>The request was malformed or unexpected.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>Unauthorized</td>
<td>The request did not include a valid API key</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>404</td>
<td>Not Found</td>
<td>The requested resource was not found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>429</td>
<td>Too Many Requests</td>
<td>The rate limit has been reached for this API key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>500</td>
<td>Internal Server Error</td>
<td>The request could not be fulfilled due to an unexpected
error.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
## Versioning
APIs should be properly versioned. APIs evolve and change, we must do this while supporting
old versions. Otherwise, if you just change your API, a lot of your clients would be in trouble.
Although, we won't be developing multiple versions (today we're working on V1), it is important
that we plan for the future and properly namespace our documentation and work under V1 namespace.
## Releases
**Note about testing:** *Tests, especially while building an API are NOT optional or nice to have.
In general, an untested app is not worth having ;) Today, we're going to try to TDD our way through this app. 

1. Decide which endpoint you want to write.
2. Add a section in the README describing the behavior of that endpoint.
3. Write the simplest failing test you can think of for that endpoint.
4. See the test fail.
5. Write code to make that test pass.
6. return to step 3. If there is nothing else you can test on that endpoint, return to step 1.

### Release 0: Documentation
Designing an API starts with documentation. Without proper and detailed documentation
an API would not be dependable. What should you include? Let's follow [Twitter's REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) model.
We will not implement or write a single piece of code until we get our documentation right, this is an
essential part of this exercise and it's not trivial. Rename this file to `lesson.md` and replace it with your `README.md` file.

### Release 1: Implement GET requests
_pending approval of documentation from an instructor_

Implement the following endpoints:
- `[GET]` list of cats
- `[GET]` a cat by id

### Release 2: Implement POST, PUT and DELETE requests
_pending approval of documentation from an instructor_

Implement the following endpoints:
- `[POST]` create a cat 
- `[PUT]` modify a cat by id 
- `[DELETE]` delete a cat by id
